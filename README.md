# Roundcube plugin searchbox_scope
Roundcube plugin to set the default search box scope to "All folders" and all fields except "Body" and "Entire message"

Many users think the Roundcube search box performs a search in all folders, but Roundecue by deafult searches only in the currcet select folder

This plugin changes the default search scope to all folders, and and all fields except "Body" and "Entire message" [*](#note1)

## Requirements

I only test this plugin with following environments. Other setup may work with luck.

- Roundcube 1.3.8+
- Roundcube skins Larry and Litecube-f (**it does not work well with Classic skin**)



## Note1
